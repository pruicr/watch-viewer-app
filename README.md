# MEAN App for displaying watches

I wrote this MEAN app to display my watch collection. It has a RESTful API and full CRUD functions.

## Run Locally

In order to run this on your own machine, clone the repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pruicr/watch-viewer-app.git
```

install the dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

add a Mongo database to `/public/index.html`, run the server:

```sh
$ node server
```

then direct a browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Live Version

You can find a live version of this app running at `https://disney-watches.herokuapp.com`, though the 'watch view is not complete. I will be updating this ASAP.
